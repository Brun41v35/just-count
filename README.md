# Just Count

Just Count is a simple iOS application that allows users to increment and decrement a counter. The main goal of this project was to study and practice Swift testing.

## Features

- Increment or decrement the counter by 1 or 5
- Reset the counter to zero
- Displays whether the current value is positive or negative

## Purpose

This project was created as a learning exercise to explore and implement unit testing in Swift. It provides a straightforward interface to focus on testing logic and UI behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `JustCount.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the simulator or a physical device.

## Testing

To run the tests, select the `JustCountTests` target and press `Cmd+U` in Xcode.
